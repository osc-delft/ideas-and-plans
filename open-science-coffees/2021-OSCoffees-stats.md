# Some minimal statistics from open science coffees in 2021

- TUD partners help bring in more registrants from TUD and those who were new to the community

Coffee | Total registrants | TUD members | Of which researchers/teachers/students | Of which OSCD members
---|---|---|---|---
Sep 2021 | 95 | 29 (31%) | 14 | 24 (83%)
Oct 2021 | 65 | 36 (55%) | 19 | 12 (33%)
Nov 2021 | 61 | 28 (46%) | 12 | 13 (46%)

- Twitter (at least the OSCDelft handle and following) is not very useful for attracting TUD Participants

*The data below only show registrants affiliated with TUD who responded to the question about how they heard about the coffee, and this question was only added from the Oct 2021 session.*
