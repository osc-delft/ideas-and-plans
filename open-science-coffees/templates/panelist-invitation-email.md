Subject: Invitation to join a coffee discussion on [topic for discussion]

Dear [panellist name],

Hope you’re well!

I’m hosting a small, virtual open science “coffee” at the Technical University of Delft (TU Delft), the Netherlands, to discuss “[topic]”. I would love to invite you to join and share some of your experience and thoughts on [what they bring to the discussion].

Why you? :) [Reasons you'd like to have them at the event, and reasons they should participate in the event - what's in it for them?]

The discussion will take place **[date and time in their time zone]** ([see this in your time zone]), online via Zoom.

More about the event: 1 hour in the format of a loose panel discussion – you’ll be joined by 2 other panellists (from different backgrounds) and I will be hosting. I will share the 3-4 questions beforehand, after we finish those we’ll open the floor to more questions/comments from the audience, who are researchers, teachers & research support staff (mostly from TU Delft, but we’ll be advertising the session on social media and open the registration to anyone who wishes to join).

Please let me know if you’d be available and interested, and/or if I can clarify anything – I’m also happy to have a chat about this, if it’s helpful.

Many thanks,
[Your name]
