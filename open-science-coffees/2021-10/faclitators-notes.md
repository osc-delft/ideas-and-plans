# OS Coffee Oct 2021 - facilitor notes

Wed Oct 6, 12.45-13.45 CEST

Registration link:  https://tudelft.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUtcOCsrj8qGtRXTxv86bSZKOe_EQ_D_5cF 

Topic: Diversity and inclusion in research, technology and design

Facilitators: Emmy Tsang, Esther Plomp

Recording link: https://youtu.be/jLnB2LLJTzA

## Abstract
TU Delft researchers are designing and engineering technologies, systems and frameworks that aim to solve some of the biggest global challenges, from climate change to health. At the same time, we see new technologies causing unwarranted consequences that often fall on minorities and the most vulnerable in our society. Our society is increasingly losing trust in "experts". Our research environments are built for the elite and wealthy, systemically excluding the under-represented. While "open science" and "team science" climb on the agendas of organisations from UNESCO to the Dutch National Funder NWO, are our research, engineering and design processes open for all to participate? Who is missing from our conversations and processes and how does this impact our work? How do we ensure that our work can truly be *global, collaborative and open*?

## Questions
*Please do edit/suggest - we'd love to highlight parts of your work that you would like the community to learn about!*

> I'll start with this order: Eriol, David, Roberto, and then rotate around for each question.

1.	Please introduce yourselves to everyone! How did you get to where you are?
    > Please highlight what motivated you to center diversity and inclusion in your field of work
2.	What does diversity and inclusion mean to you?
    > Emmy: i think you all addressed in your intros so i'm going to skip ahead :) 
4.	What are the main representation issues in our research and technology development and design processes and cultures, and what impact do they have?
    > Specific stories & experiences would be really helpful here
    > 
    > Roberto: just for our reference, in our chat you talked about a lot of academics choosing to collaborate with prestigious institutions in the Global North, which is really nice to highlight.
    - (audience submitted follow-up) What is the impact of different ideas and biases from different cultures in pursuing diversity and inclusion?
5.	(To Roberto) Tell us more about some of the initiatives that you've organised to ensure people from all around the globe can participate in your field of research?
6.	(To David) Could you tell us a bit more about your work at Growing Gold Farms, and what is special about your approach towards redefining agriculture in Ghana?
7.	(To Eriol) Why should designers work openly - what benefits are there for the designers, and what can designers uniquely bring to open-source technology development?
8.	Many of us here are collaboratively developing and designing technologies to tackle global challenges, e.g. in climate, health, etc. Any advice that you would offer/practical steps one could take to ensure that our work can truly serve people worldwide and our planet? 

## Questions from audience
> I've removed full names to anonymise questions.
- [To Eriol] We have now wide spread acceptance of open source licenses but is it time to move forward and move beyond just open source licenses and move towards ethical licenses? Examples: https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/
    > Eriol - would you like me to ask this one first before Q6 above? Emmy
    > MX: Really interesting and challenging topic. Questions for Eriol (feel free to read it): how comes that closed software funded your open source project? 
Any good/bad experiences and schemes on getting funding for open-source projects?
- JZ: Q for Roberto: Considering that command of English may be another form of privilege, how can we get on board non-English speakers in the inclusive co-creation of knowledge? Thanks for the fantastic discussion and amazing panelists!
- Thanks for all really inspiring insights. I would be interested to hear what David would think of this research project of TU Delft, of which I was very fond of, but now I am doubting...: https://www.tudelft.nl/global/stories/20000-weather-stations-in-africa 
- MX: Really interesting and challenging topic. Questions for Eriol (feel free to read it):how comes that closed software funded your open source project? Any good/bad experiences and schemes on getting funding for open-source projects?
