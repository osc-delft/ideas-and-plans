## What is this process- what are the goals?
OSCD members can request a small amount of money to support their attendance at an open science-related conference. This is how one can process those requests.

## Steps of the process
> This is not a very well-known scheme, so it's good to advertise it from time to time, in newsletters, Slack, etc.

1. When a request from a member is received, ask how much they would like to request for when, and whether they would be willing to write a blog post about their experience afterwards, or share their experience at a community event.
2. Give heads-up and check the budget with Alastair D.
3. After the event, the member should use the standard TUD expense claim procedure to claim the money. If they need more assistance, they can ask their department secretaries. Community coordinator has access to the necessary budget codes.
4. Blog post: if needed, members can structure their blog post by addressing the following questions:
  - What motivated you to join the conference?
  - (briefly) What was the conference about? Around how many people, from where, what format is it in?
  - What is one thing that you learnt during the conference?
  - What is one thing that surprised/intrigued you at the conference? (maybe something that you kept thinking about, or would like to dig into a bit more after)
  - Would you recommend other researchers to join the conference - if yes, why?
  - You can see an example of [a previous blog post](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2022/01/11/mri-together-2021/).
5. Community coordinator should help review the blog post, and (if necessary) publish it on [OpenWorking](https://openworking.wordpress.com/) on behalf of the member, cross-posting to the [OSCD Stories page](https://osc-delft.github.io/posts).
