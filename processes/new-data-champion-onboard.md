## What is this process- what are the goals?
When new OSCD members sign up to be a data champion, this process ensures they're added to the correct section of the website and the mailing list.

## Steps of the process
1. Ways to become a data champion:
  - All faculty members are alerted of the opportunity in the OSCD onboarding email. Their faculty data steward is cc-ed in their onboarding email, which gives them an opportunity to reach out to the new member and check.
  - Data stewards may also want to highlight this opportunity in their interactions with faculty members. If faculty members would like to be a data champion, they should first [sign up](https://osc-delft.github.io/join) to be a member of OSC Delft.
2. OSCD member who want to become a data champion should first inform their faculty data steward/community coordinator. Data steward would then email community coordinator indicating this.
3. Add member to the Data Champions mailing list.
4. (If member has a public OSCD profile) Add member to the data champions list on the website by adding their name to the data champions section in `members-metadata.yaml` (link: https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/blob/master/_data/members-metadata.yaml).
