Topic: Open Data & Software in Tackling the Climate Crisis

Facilitators: Emmy Tsang, Alessandra Candian

Recording link: https://youtu.be/HUiEADH686o

## Abstract
The climate crisis is a global issue. To gain a full understanding of the issue and to design effective solutions and interventions, it is essential to have data and software that can process, analyse and visualise the data.  It is also crucial that researchers, technologists, policymakers, and everyone interested in helping tackle the climate crisis have access to and can use and collaborate around the data and software. What are the challenges and opportunities in working with climate data? How can open data and software help facilitate collaboration across research, industry and governments in our fight against the climate crisis?

## Warm up
1. Session will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube, please switch off camera if you'd not like to be on the recording
2. Welcome, and Emmy & Alessandra's intro (OSCD coordinator and facilitators of this session)
3. CoC reminders
    > put this link in chat: Full Code of Conduct: https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
3. Format of the event:
    - We are very grateful to have 3 panellists join us today!
    - I will start the session off with some questions for our panellists
    - Afterwards, we will open the floor to all of your questions and comments. 
        - Please use the raise your hand button if you wish to ask a questions/comment, we will ask you to unmute yourself
        - You can also type your questions/comments in the Zoom chat at any point, we will collect them and either ask them on your behalf or ask if you'd like to unmute, when the time comes.

## Panellists introductions
- Nick van de Giesen, Full Professor, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geoscience, TU Delft
- Maarten Plieger, Senior Software Engineer, KNMI
- Diána Szász: Programme Lead - Data Ecosystems and Innovation, Open Data Institute

## Questions
*Please do edit/suggest - we'd love to highlight parts of your work that you would like the community to learn about!*
> We'll start in this order: Nick, Maarten, Diana; then rotate for every question

1. Please introduce yourselves briefly to everyone, and tell us a bit about how you've come to work at the intersections of data, software and climate.

2. In your experience, what are some of the challenges in working with climate data?

3. What is open data/software to you, and why do you think it is important in tackling climate change?
    > Stories/specific cases would help illustrate this.

4. You all have very different roles within different organisations (university, government, non-profit) - what is the climate data/software ecosystem that you'd like to see in 10 years time?
    > This can be anything from better APIs and documentation to more funding for data infrastructures in LMICs.

5. Many of us here are researchers - what is one pratical step that you would recommend we take to facilitate collaboration and reuse around our data/software, so that we can tackle climate change together?


## Questions from audience
- [ ] How could someone participate in a scientific project related to climate change?
- [ ] What is the primary goal for using open software and data in tackling the climate crisis?
- [x] Are the data standards not (fully) agreed or are these not enforced? Is there an entity that orchestrates this? from Giorgia 
- [x] For Nick - Can you comment on the differences in making data openly available for "big institutes" like KNMI versus individual researchers (say, a PhD student that wants to share their outputs)? from Peter
- [x] It seems there are already existing “climate data marketplaces”, which are platforms where people can share data, where data has meta-data tags etc. Is it not possible to use these existing platforms? from Giorgia
- [x] What kind of costs do you mean? 4TU, DANS and Zenodo are for free. from Markus
