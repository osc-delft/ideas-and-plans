Dear [panellists' names],

First – thank you so much for agreeing to join us at the upcoming Open Science Coffee on [title]. I can’t express how excited I am about having you in the same “room” – the community can really benefit from the diverse perspectives and experiences that you have.

A few bits of logistical information:
1.	The session will take place **Date and time in panellists' time zone(s)**.
  a.	I’d be grateful If you could please sign on ~10 mins before the event for a tech check
2.	It will take place on **Zoom**, please **register for the event with [this link](Zoom registration link)** so you can get the joining link and the option to add it to your calendar
3.	We and friendly networks will be publicizing the event on Twitter (we’re [@oscdelft](https://twitter.com/OSCDelft)) – please check the attached graphic and let me know If I’ve made any mistakes.
  a.	If you are on Twitter, we’ll mention you in the relevant Tweets – let me know if you’d rather we don’t.
  b.	The session is targeted towards TU Delft scholars but generally open for all to participate, so please feel free to invite friends and colleagues to join!
4.	The information about the event and registration link is now up on our [community event page](https://osc-delft.github.io/events)- please let me know if there are any issues/suggestions, via email or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/issues).
5.	I’d like to introduce the session’s co-facilitator [co-facilitator's name] (cc-ed). [Some description about co-facilitator, e.g. They are an avid open and inclusive research advocate], and I’m glad they have agreed to help out with managing the Zoom chat and relaying questions during the session.
6.	I would like to record the session for those who can’t attend in real-time – please let me know if you’d rather I don’t. The plan is to upload the recording to YouTube and share it on [our community blog](https://osc-delft.github.io/posts) shortly after the event.
7.	The session is an Open Science Community Delft event, so operates under our [community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) – please take a moment to read it and make sure you’re aware of the unacceptable behaviours and reporting procedures.

As promised, [the questions](link to the facilitators' notes on HackMD) that I (as the facilitator of the session) am planning to ask you. After these questions, the floor will be opened to other participants for comments and questions.

Please do use the HackMD to suggest improvements to these questions and/or other questions that I should ask, especially if there are experiences/initiatives that you’d like to highlight.

Please don’t hesitate to let me know if anything is unclear, or if you have questions! I look forward to seeing you all virtually on [date]!

Many thanks,
[Your name]
