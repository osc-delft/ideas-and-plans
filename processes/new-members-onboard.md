## What is this process- what are the goals?
When new members sign up via the sign up form, this process welcomes them to the community and ensure that they're added to the website and mailing(s) accordingly.

## Steps of the process
1. Check the submission - does the member want to be listed on the public members' list?
  - If yes, go to step 2
  - If not, go to step 5
2. Upload their photo to `images/members` in the website repository, which will give us a link to the photo
  - remember to use the `raw=true` link
3. Submit an PR with the public profile info that the member added to `people.yaml`, and them added to `members-metadata.yaml`
4. Review and merge
5. Add the members' email address to the open science mailing list
6. Send the onboarding email below, cc-ing faculty data steward
